#summary What's this?.

= Introduction =

I wrote this script to convert my rather lengthy cisco ACL rules to vyatta firewall rules.  I hope it can be of some use for other folks using vyatta from cisco.


= Details =

Code isn't pretty, could use command line options etc.  but since it's only run once or twice I didn't think it needed it.

If you extend the code, please let me know, I'd love to check in the changes.
